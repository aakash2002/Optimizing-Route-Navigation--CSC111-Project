# Optimizing Route Navigation in London 
This is a project made by a group of 4 students at the University of Toronto as a part of the final project for the CSC111 course.

The project discusses on how we can optimize route navigation between different places in London. The program with the help of its several computational methods, visualizes the possible routes between 2 given junctions and compares and contrasts the most optimal routes with different colours.

The formal report dives deeper into the project highlighting the limitations and possible solutions to the question of route optimization.
